# Secret Chart
[![Artifact HUB](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https://artifacthub.io/badge/repository/k8s-as-helm)](https://artifacthub.io/packages/search?repo=k8s-as-helm)

## TL;DR;

```console
$ helm repo add k8s-as-helm https://ameijer.github.io/k8s-as-helm/
$ helm install my-release k8s-as-helm/secret
```

## Introduction

Helm charts are great! They are really configurable and let you build complicated software stacks in seconds. Tools like [Helmfile](https://github.com/roboll/helmfile) combine helm charts together to allow you to set up an environment consisting entirely of helm releases. 

Let's say, though, you want to add additional code to a third party helm chart. You could make a new chart with your K8s API resource and the third party chart as a dependency, but that requires maintenance which might not be worth it if you only needed a single additional resource created. That's where k8s-as-helm charts come in. These charts wrap a single Kubernetes resource in a helm chart with all the key parameters exposed. 

The secret chart deploys a single Kubernetes Secret object.

## Installation 

```console
$ helm repo add k8s-as-helm https://ameijer.github.io/k8s-as-helm/
$ helm install my-release k8s-as-helm/secret
```

## Configuration

The following table lists the configurable parameters of the secret chart and their default values.

`type` | the type of the Secret object | `Opaque`
`secretData` | Map of key/value pairs to be included in the `data` field of the secret. Values will be base64 encoded | `null`
`secretDataEncoded` | Map of already encoded key/value pairs to be included in the `data` field of the secret. | `{}`
